# RecallMate
An app to strengthen memory recall. Usefull for career development, student education, and personal goals. 

As people rely more and more on search engines and AI to give them answers, the ability to recall and retain information declines.
This reliance can significantly worsen peoples productivity, motivation, and problem solving. Remembering something will always be faster and less mentally straining than researching infromation repeatedly. Recallmate is a solution to this problem.

Users can create and review information cards, which will appear in a spaced repetition pattern following the fibonacci sequence.
for example after creating a card it will reappear for review on days
1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21...

Users can also add required questions, that they must answer correctly when reviewing or the sequence will reset.
